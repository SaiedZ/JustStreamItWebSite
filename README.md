# JustStreamIt


General info
The mision for this project was to create a website with HTML/CSS and display different categories of movies in a carousel from an API that was given to us at the start.

The user neede the possibility scroll right and left on the carousel and pick a movie of his choice, when clicked a modal window would appear and display all the infos from that movie.
